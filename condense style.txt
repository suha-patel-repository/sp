to have your code more concise and to the point, create another html file named 
styles.css which will contain: 

h1{ 

color: red; 
text-align: center; 
} 
p{ 

color: red; 

} 
 and in your main src file write: 

<head> 
<title> blah </title> 
< link rel ="stylesheet" href " styles.css"> 
</head> 
//outside the body
